# Emreal Harmonic Node Series

This repository contains verified Python scripts and a Jupyter notebook for computing and analyzing nine foundational harmonic series (HN₁–HN₉) related to the Emreal Constant (≈ 0.7696). These series explore prime individuation, modular recursion, symbolic symmetry, and convergence behaviors across various symbolic modulation systems.

## Contents

- `HN_P.py` – Prime Individuation Series
- `HN_B.py` – Reciprocal Balance Series
- `HN_M.py` – Mean Modulation Series
- `HN_R.py` – Recursive Modulation Series
- `HN_F.py` – Feedback Modulation Series
- `HN_I.py` – Inverse Modulation Series
- `HN_pi.py` – Pi Ratio Series
- `HN_O.py` – Opposite Mirror Series
- `HN_phi.py` – Golden Damping Series
- `HN_Summary.ipynb` – Notebook with all scripts and plots
- `LICENSE` – Open-source (MIT)
- `requirements.txt` – Minimal dependencies

## Usage

Run the `.py` scripts directly using Python 3, or open the notebook in Google Colab for an interactive view of results and graphs. Each script prints the first and last 12 iterations, as well as averaged convergence behavior.
